# isn_motus python
Here is my first programming project done in 2020 (in Terminal), in collaboration with Maxime M. and Emeline R. and especially boost by Thomas L. thanks to them. 
It is a game called MOTUS, using the same operation of the french famous tv show of the same name. Hope you'll enjoy ;)
Have a nice game & just enjoy ^^
